Made by "The Team" for GGJ Singapore 2024, Pl.ai.giarism (yes it's purposely misspelt) is an overhead stealth game where you play as an A.I. robot sneaking through high-security museums, filled with guards and other A.I. security tech, and try to steal as much art as you can to sell as your own.

(All AI art are hand-drawn by us)

## Contributions: 
For this project, I worked heavily on all the enemy AI which includes:

<ul>
<li> Idle, Patrol, Alerted, and Distracted states.</li>
<li> Individual alertness level system.</li>
<li> Communicating with other guards in the vicinity.</li>
<li> Interaction with distraction interactibles.</li>
</ul>
