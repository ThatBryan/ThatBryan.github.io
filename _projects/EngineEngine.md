Made by "The Team" for GGJ Singapore 2024, Pl.ai.giarism (yes it's purposely misspelt) is an overhead stealth game where you play as an A.I. robot sneaking through high-security museums, filled with guards and other A.I. security tech, and try to steal as much art as you can to sell as your own.

(All AI art are hand-drawn by us)

Check it out <a href="https://globalgamejam.org/games/2024/plaigiarism-4" target="_blank">here</a>.
