Hello World! My name is Bryan, I'm a Junior at the DigiPen Institute of Technology majoring in Computer Science in Real-Time Interactive Simulation.

I've been building software in C++ for over 2 years, mostly games and game engines for Windows. <br>
I specialize in game engine architecture, tools development and gameplay programming.

During my time as an undergraduate at DigiPen, other than making games, I've dabbled in cloud computing using AWS, mobile app development, parallel programming and more.

I love technology, video games, and building software.
